# cluttered and slow but **learning**
Here i am making a document data base while also learning on how to use git and github.
That explains the redundancy of the files being created.

Why are you publishing it to public?
I don't know. Being a self-taught seems lonely, especially when debugging.

Maybe I just want a friend ahaha.
