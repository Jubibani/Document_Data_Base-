# Overview
We have to admit that it can be a hassle when you are trying to find a folder or a file for your work especially within a big pile of your documents. This project aims to help optimize your work by organizing your documents with the click of a button. A data-Base Project.
This was requested by my father due to his hectic work. I took it as an opportunity for investing in my skills and for future work. 
While I perceived it as great and an exciting activity to do. certainly there are problems especially for getting stuck. at first i was able to make a prototype out of it for visualizing the project. next up was the initial construction with the use of python and a library called kivy. I decided to use mongo db but it was too hard for me to understand and it was limited only to 5mb which is bad for creating a database project. It should hold many megabyte since it is a storing software so i eventually dropped the idea.
I came up with a solution by creating my own database system. while it is so daring to do, i want to perceive this as a challenge not hard and impossible. like what most successful programmers say, "your attitude determines your altitude". It would be best to have a positive mindset always.
